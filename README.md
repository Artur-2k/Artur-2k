Hi, I’m @Artur-2k. I used to be in the military and now life is more quiet since i started to code 
I enjoy pretty much everything that is related to science and  filosophy and now code too :)
I’m currently learning C at 42Porto and by myself so expect mistakes (a lot of them) and try not to cringe on them xd
